# Data Source

This is an example data file which houses all xlsx tables from Statistics Canada.

The R scripts take the xlsx files and convert them into a machine readable csv file.

e.g. 2015_IND_Tables_1_to_13_Canada.xlsx OR 2015_Family_Tables_1_to_18_Canada.xlsx

To work with the data using R scripts, simply change file input line to include an appropriate data file name.\
